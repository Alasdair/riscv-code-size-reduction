= Code Size meeting minutes 23rd Feb 2021

Unfortuantely my laptop crashed and I lost the minutes, here's what I can remember the next day:

SIG + TG - we need to create a code optimisation SIG, through Toolchains and Runtimes

Global Pointer optimisation - there are some pretty severe limitation at the moment where it doesn't catch all variables which are in-range.  
It seems like this can be improved during LTO, let's discuss next week.

RISC-V forum coming up - please submit papers
RICV-V exchange - list your RISC-V related boards and services here

PUSH/POP proof of concept - the Huawei implementation isn't quite the same, so do we need another proof of concept? And what about different options? 
Do we need a proof of concept for each? Talk to Allen about this.

CAS/ICT are available for proof of concept.

Talk to Dan Lustig about non-idempotent memory for PUSH/POP.

Hi3861 platform + software + HCC are available for download - to allow anyone to benchmark WiFi-IoT code.
