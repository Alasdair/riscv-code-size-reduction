= Meeting Minutes for Code-size Reduction 2020/12/01

We had two presentations this week

== Matteo Perotti presented RVfplib
- ~ 60% smaller than libgcc
- ~ 2x speedup on benchmarks

Some points to address

- divide is slower than libgcc, and doesn't yet use the hardware divider
- the GPL license is too restrictive, libgcc uses GPL with an exclusion
- what about producing a speed optimised version
- benchmarks are internal or Embench, which doesn't have much FP, apparently BEEBS has more, and some others listed by Jeremy
- interesting to look at the relative speedup on ARM of the optimised vs unoptimised library
- the most useful code size metric is for linked code, as oppose to the raw library size
- intersting to also compare against the ARC library

Ideally this will be used to replace parts of libgcc

- corporate assignments are required to submit to FSF
- Jim Wilson can advise on the process


== David Horner presented CALLVEC

- a generic mechanism to replace sequenced / micro-coded instructions
- a more concrete example would be useful to understand how it would replace push/pop
- this might be more appropriate for the unpriv/priv committees as it's a general mechanism, not list limited to code size reduction
