= Code-size reduction ISA extension status

This shows the code-size reduction status of proposed ISA extensions on the four main benchmarks.
Huawei IoT (2 cores - application and protocol)
Zephyr (2 cores - central and peripheral)

[NOTE]

  We need more large, real benchmarks which we can recompile with different compiler options

[NOTE]

  The baseline code-size for these tables is to compile the benchmarks on HCC with `-msave-restore`

=== 16-bit load/store byte/half unsigned

[ldstbh_status_table]

|===================================================================================================
|            |IoT application |IoT protocol |Zephyr Central |Zephyr Peripheral

We may decide that a shorter immediate value is acceptable for `c.lbu/c.lhu/c.sb/c.sh` or to only implement `c.lbu/c.sb` as the benefit is highest.
The proposal is https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_ldst_bh_extension.rst[here]

|===================================================================================================

The proposal is https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_condbr_imm_extension.rst[here]
We need to analyse the encoding space used - which includes two immediates - branch offset and compare immediate.

== Proposals which save < 0.5%

=== Multi-move

The multi-move proposal is https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/ISA%20proposals/Huawei/multi_move.adoc[here]. I'm roughly estimating about 0.4% reduction (accurate analysis to be done). 

=== 32-bit MULIADD

[muliadd_status_table]
.compare-imediate-branch status
[width=100%,options="header",]
|===================================================================================================
|            |IoT application |IoT protocol |Zephyr Central |Zephyr Peripheral
5+|Compiled with HCC, relative to baseline
| MULIADD    | 0.20%  | 0.32% | 0.15% | 0.10%  
|===================================================================================================

Proposal is https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_muladd_extension.rst[here].
It takes too much encoding space, Clare Wolf has a proposal for a cheaper version:

See the https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-bitmanip/topic/multiply_immediate_add/78289291?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,78289291[email thread] and the 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rZnfWd4_K50rtPeg-yQD4h5mKcjOoghwzNg4u30Hyx0/edit#gid=0[analysis results]

Clare also proposed `MULI` and `ADDIADD`.

Maybe these should go into the next version of bit manip?

=== `C.ZEXT[BH]`

[czext_status_table]
.`c.zext[bh]` status
[width=100%,options="header",]
|===================================================================================================
|            |IoT application |IoT protocol |Zephyr Central |Zephyr Peripheral
5+|Compiled with HCC, relative to baseline
| c.zext[bh] | 0.29%  | 0.32% | 0.17% | 0.12%  
|===================================================================================================

The benchmarks are for two 3-bit operand specifiers: `c.zext[bh] rd', rs1'`
It would be more sensible to limit the encoding space an use a single 3-bit src/dst operand: `c.zext[bh] rd'`
The instructions zero extend either a byte or half-word up to the full register width, and expand to `zext.[bh]` in the B-extension.

== To be analysed

== `lwgp/swgp`

Proposal is listed on https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/ISA%20proposals/Huawei/32bit_encodings.adoc[this page].
It could benefit from a separate proposal page.
I expect the benefit to be high (> 2%),

== others

These will probably offer small improvements, I estimate around 0.1% for each. They could be considered more as speed improvements for specific algorithms which need them.

- `C.SEXT.*`
- `C.MUL`
