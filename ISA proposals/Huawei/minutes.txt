SIGs will continue to provide oversight along with HCs, TGs come and go

this group charters code-size TG

shoudl make a proposal for code optimisation to the T&R HSC
 - under UNPRIV, dotted line to CODE-OPT

code-size optimisation is a big gap

Evandro and Christoph to take ownership, and bring a proposal to T&R

board says to divide and conquer - is it ok to postpone some instructions?
list the work that needs to be done, e.g. benchmarking PUSH.F
discuss plan next week
including PoC configs

explain encoding strategy at next chairs meeting 

Anders can generate encoding table form their tools, and check they are valid

SWGP -> SWTP, change available to implied


Evandro maybe think about RV64 more e.g. LDGP, SWGP
Also test RVE, specify EABI versions, note can't be finalised yet
- ask EABI group about the latest spec - hopefully stable doc next week

CLIC is table of pointers

What's the benefit of not having C+Zce

notes about 16/32-bit encodings got push/pop/tbljal in the doc

-> Zcecm is redundant, as you'd never specify it in the config string, dotted line

embedded profile - talk to Krste and Greg - for Mark's meeting with Krste on friday

remove Zced from Zce, Zced implies not D
rename Zced to Zcen/Zcels

Anders - to look at C.DECBGEZ


Fix the encoding - looks like there is overlap on C.POPRET.E
spimm[5:4] not spimm[1:0]

DH - concern about subsets, let's get input from Krste before changing it, but concern noted

DECBGEZ: analysis of patterns - BNEZ is an easier solution, and Anders will do some more work and we can udpate it next week if he's still happy with that
(PPC instruction DECBGEZ) GCC uses C.BGEZ/C.BNEZs that's what's available

MULI needs 10 bit immediate
report MULIADD when MULI already inferred

why ADDIADD is so high for HUFFBENCH
- can release the script first then Paolo can run it
