Pre-shifted Arithmetic Proposal
===============================

This proposal is based upon https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_preshifted_arithmetic.rst[this one]
which should be read first.

Viewing this https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/Huawei%20IoT%20preshifted%20arithmetic%20usage.xlsx[spreadsheet] 
we see that the following ISA additions gain most of the benefit of the previous extension, whilst taking up much less encoding space.

|===============================================================================
|Instruction         | Semantics            | Description
3+|new instructions
|SH8OR rd, rs1, rs2  | rd = rs1 + (rs2<<8)  | shift rs2 left 8  places and add to rs1
|SH16OR rd, rs1, rs2 | rd = rs1 + (rs2<<16) | shift rs2 left 16 places and add to rs1
|SH24OR rd, rs1, rs2 | rd = rs1 + (rs2<<24) | shift rs2 left 24 places and add to rs1
|C.RORI rd, shamt    | rd = ror(rd, shamt)  | rotate rd right shamt places, encoding not checked to see if rd is 5 bits or 3
3+|B-extension instructions
|SH1ADD rd, rs1, rs2 | rd = rs1 + (rs2<<1)  | shift rs2 left 1 place and add to rs1
|SH2ADD rd, rs1, rs2 | rd = rs1 + (rs2<<2)  | shift rs2 left 2 places and add to rs1
|SH3ADD rd, rs1, rs2 | rd = rs1 + (rs2<<3)  | shift rs2 left 3 places and add to rs1
|===============================================================================

The reason to add `C.ROR` is so that it is possible to construct all the 32-bit encodings from the previous proposal using 2 x 16-bit encodings, 
with restricted register usage and overwriting `rs2` compared to the 32-bit encodings.

`C.SLLI/C.SRLI/C.SRAI/C.ROR` followed by `C.ADD/C.SUB/C.OR/C.XOR/C.AND`

Therefore the most common instructions are added above so that full 32-bit encodings are available allowing unrestricted register usage, and also preserving the value of `rs2`.

[NOTE]
  `C.ROR` has low benefit for the Huawei IoT code (see the spreadsheet), it may be useful for other applications. TBD.

`C.SH8OR/C.SH18OR/C.SH24OR` could also be useful. In the IoT code 87% of uses rd==rs1, although in only 67% of cases registgers are allocated into the 8-register set.
If the registers can be allocated successfully these 16-bit encodings would be very useful. The isntructions seem to be used for packing bytes into words, e.g.

 1000f76:	30c7271b          	orshf	a4,a4,a2,sll,24

so it's possible that a different pack bytes strategy could be used instead of these instructions.
