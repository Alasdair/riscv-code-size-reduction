This document describesï¼š

* 32-bit encodings for `PUSH/PUSH.[FDQ]`, `POP/POP.[FDQ]` and `POPRET/POPRET.[FDQ]`
* 16-bit encodings for `C.PUSH, C.POP` and `C.POPRET` instructions 

The instructions are defined for RV32, RV64 and RV128 architectures I variants only, using the UABI. 

Future revisions may include:

* The E variant
* EABI support

These instructions are to reduce the code-size of function prologues and epilogues by using a single encoding to replace a sequence of instructions. 
They are designed to replace common function prologue/epilogue sequences, but will not replace all possible cases. 

== Open issues

it's better to list these first, as they are resolved I'll update the proposal

* allocate encodings for the 32-bit versions
* whether to allow x-registers to be specified in the assembler syntax instead of only ABI names
** only using ABI names should make it easier to work with the EABI as well, as those names don't change but the x-register mappings do. Providing the hardware knows which ABI is in use then this can work, so the disassembly works seamlessly. TBD.
* whether the fault handling should be profile defined

=== Extra proposal PUSH + MV

The example is from FPMark but most functions when compiled with HCC or GCC10 are the same:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
0001085c <floatXRoundToInt>:
   10862:       8258                    push    {ra,s0-s3},-64
   10876:       89b2                    mv      s3,a2
   10878:       892e                    mv      s2,a1
   1087a:       842a                    mv      s0,a0
----

I observe that _almost_ every function saves one or more argument (`a`) registers as part of the prologue. This is so common that it is costing a considerable amount of code-size. In this example the `mv` instructions take significantly more code-size than the `c.push` instruction.

Therefore the proposal is to automatically include them into the `c.push` instruction, so that no more encoding space is used.
Therefore there will be occasions when

* the `push` instruction issues too many `mv` instructions, which costs performance
** given that `-msave-restore` saves/restores registers which are not needed, I don't see this as a problem, `mv` instructions are cheap in comparison
* the `push` instruction issues too few `mv` instructions so the compiler will generate more

Neither of these are a problem, and the code size will improve.

* For the 16-bit encoding the number of registers will be based on the number of registers saved.
* for the 32-bit encoding the number of registers _may_ be controlled by a field in the encoding, TBD

Initial analysis shows that the automatic register saves  in <<rcount-table>> _may_ be optimal.
The code-size reduction will initially be analysed for this configuration.

== Assembler Syntax

//these encodings may be 16-bit or 32-bit depending upon the parameters
push           {<xreg_list>},  -<stack_adjustment>
pop            {<xreg_list>},   <stack_adjustment> 
popret         {<xreg_list>},   <stack_adjustment> 

//these encodings are 32-bit as F registers are included in the list, the length of the F registers is specified in the encoding

pop.[fdq]      {<fxreg_list>},  <stack_adjustment> 
popret.[fdq]   {<fxreg_list>},  <stack_adjustment> 
----

. `PUSH` pushes the registers specified in `[f]xreg_list` to the stack, and then adjust the stack pointer by the `stack_adjustment`.
. `POP` pops the registers in `[f]xreg_list to the stack` from the stack, and then adjusts the stack pointer by the `stack_adjustment`.
. `POPRET` has the same behaviour as `POP`, followed by `RET`.

32-bit and 16-bit forms are available, the assembler should choose the 16-bit form if the parameters permit and the C extension is implemented.

The registers in `xreg_list` are in a comma separated list. The list must not be empty.

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
<reg_list>   ::= <xreg_list> | <fxreg_list>
<xreg_list>  ::= <ra> "," <xreg_range> | <ra> | <xreg_range>
<fxreg_list> ::= <ra> "," <xreg_range> ", " <freg_range> | <ra> "," <freg_range> | <xreg_range> "," <freg_range> | <freg_range>
<xreg_range> ::= <s0>  | <s0-sN>   (where `N` is in the range [1, 11])
<freg_range> ::= <fs0> | <fs0-fsM> (valid values of `M` are 0,1,2,3,5,8,11)
----

For the 16-bit encodings

. `ra` must be included
. `s0-sN` may be included, valid values of `N` are 0,1,2,3,5,8,11
. `fs0-fsM` must not be included
. the `stack_adjustment` must be no more than the total memory required for `xreg_list`, rounded up to a multiple of 16-bytes, plus an addition (0..7)*16-bytes.

[NOTE]
  To save encoding space some opcodes do not allow the full range of `spimm` which reduces the possible `stack adjustment` range further, see <<#16bitencodings>>

For the 32-bit encodings

. the `stack_adjustment` must be no more than the total memory required for `reg_list`, rounded up to a multiple of 16-bytes, plus an additional (0..15)*16-bytes.

For example

. `push   {ra,s0-s2}, -64` can use a 16-bit encoding
. `push.f {ra,s0-s2, fs0}, -64` must use a 32-bit encoding as `fs0` is in the register list
. `push   {ra,s0-s2}, -256` must use a 32-bit encoding as the `stack_adjustment` is out of range

To be a legal encoding:

1.  The stack adjustment must be negative for all `PUSH` variants and positive for all `POP[RET]` variants
2.  The stack adjustment must be in range (see <<spimm>>) and must be a multiple of 16
3.  The register list must be valid (see above)
4.  If any F registers are included in the list there must be a `.[fdq]` suffix
5.  It there is a `.[fdq]` suffix, there must be F registers in the list

Additionally:

. If `sp` is not 16-byte aligned then take an illegal instruction exception

[NOTE]
  When moving from accessing `x` registers to `f` registers there may be a gap as the registers may be different widths, and all registers must be aligned in memory

== Determining XLEN and FLEN to decode and execute the instructions

The width of `x` registers in the register list depends upon XLEN and so `misa.MXL`. From the ELF file header, XLEN is determined by the following flags:

* ELFCLASS64 for RV64
* ELFCLASS32 for RV32 

[NOTE]

  I don't think there's an ELFCLASS128 for RV128

If using a debugger then `misa.MXL` can be read, if XLEN is not known for the core.

FLEN is explicitly specified in the opcode as the presence of any F registers requires a `.[fdq]` suffix on the opcode.

Follow this link for details of the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md#file-header[ELF file header]

=== Rationale: why include the .[fdq] suffix

It is required to hard-code the length of the F registers in the opcode, and not just save/restore the whole register. We must allow code compiled for the F-extension
to run on a  core which supports D and possibly Q. We must also allow code compiled for the D-extension to run on a core which supports Q.

If we don't explicitly state the F register width and always store the whole register, then the registers will be stored at different addresses to the ones expected 
by the compiler. 

An alternative would be to use `misa.[FDQ]`
to directly control the behaviour and so set `misa.[DQ]=0` when running F code. Nothing else in the architecture requires this, so it seems unreasonable to 
add this requirement here.

== Pseudo-code

The pseudo-code below show the required architectural state updates. 

Note that every architectural state update in the pseudo-code can be executed as a standard RISC-V 32-bit encoding, so that it is possible execute the instructions as sequences of standard instructions. 

Because the pseudo-code includes load or store operations, they may take any fault caused by executing loads or stores. See <<fault-handling>> for more details.

=== PUSH Pseudo-code

All variants of the `PUSH` instruction store the set of registers from `reg_list` to consecutive memory locations, and decrement the stack pointer.
The pseudo-code uses assembly inserts so that it can use `fsw/fsd` etc.

The pseudo-code shows the memory and architectural state updates of the whole instruction which has completed without faults, debug halts or interrupts. See <<fault-handling>> and <<software-view>> for more information.

[NOTE]
  `stack_adjustment` is negative.

----

=== POP[RET] Pseudo-code

A `POP[RET]` instruction loads the set of registers from `reg_list` from consecutive memory locations, and then increments the stack pointer. 
The pseudo-code uses assembly inserts so that it can use `flw/fld/ret`.

The pseudo-code shows the architectural state updates of the whole instruction which has completed without faults, debug halts or interrupts. See <<fault-handling>> and <<software-view>> for more information.

[NOTE]
  `stack_adjustment` is positive.

== Encoding Fields

[#spimm]
=== `spimm` encoding field

The `stack_adjustment` field in the assembly syntax comprises of two components:

. the memory required for the registers in the list, rounded up to 16-bytes (using the `Align16` function below)
. additional stack space allocated for local variables, encoded in the `spimm` field

The 16-bit encoding allows up to 7 additional 16-byte blocks (as `spimm` has up to 3-bits), and the 32-bit encoding allows up to 31.

[NOTE]
  we may change the size of `spimm` in the 32-bit encoding once benchmarking work has completed

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
//the padding calculation requires SP to be 16-byte aligned before executing the instruction
if (FLEN>XLEN && 
    number_of_registers_in_freg_list>0 && 
    number_of_registers_in_reg_list % (FLEN/XLEN)>0) {
  //need padding to ensure FLEN registers are aligned
  padding = (FLEN/XLEN - number_of_registers_in_reg_list % (FLEN/XLEN)) * XLEN/8;

----

The bytes required for padding is simple - if FLEN==XLEN it's always zero. If FLEN=2*XLEN it is 0 or 4. RV32Q is more complex (see below) but this is an unlikely configuration.
`n` is an integer in the tables so `2n` is always even, `2n+1` is always odd.

[#fault-handling]
== Fault handling

The sequence required to execute the instruction may be interrupted, or may not be able to start execution for several reasons.

* virtual memory page fault or PMP fault
** these can be detected before execution, or during execution if the memory addresses cross a page/PMP boundary
* watchpoint trigger
** these can be detected before execution, or during execution depending on the trigger type (load data triggers require the sequence to have started executing, for example)
* external debug halt
** the halt can treat the whole sequence atomically, or interrupt mid sequence (implementation defined)
* debug halt caused by a trigger
** same comment as watchpoint trigger above
* load access fault
** these are detected while the sequence is executing
* store access fault (precise or imprecise)
** these may be detected while the sequence is executing, or afterwards if imprecise
* interrupts
** these may arrive at any time. An implementation can choose whether to interrupt the sequence or not.

Because some faults can only be detected during the sequence the core implementation is able to recover from the fault and re-execute the sequence. This may involve executing some or all of the loads and stores from the sequence multiple times before the sequence completes (as multiple faults or multiple interrupts are possible).

Therefore correct execution requires that `sp` refers to idempotent memory.

[#software-view]
== Software view of execution

=== Software view of `PUSH` sequence

From a software perspective the `PUSH` sequence appears as:

* A sequence of stores writing a contiguous block of memory. Any of the bytes may be written multiple times.
* A stack pointer adjustment

Because the memory is idempotent and the stores are non-overlapping, they may be reordered, grouped into larger accesses, split into smaller access or any combination of these.

If an implementation allows interrupts during the sequence, and the interrupt handler uses `sp` to allocate stack memory, then any stores which were executed before the interrupt maybe be overwritten by the handler. This is safe because the memory is idempotent and the stores will be re-executed once the handler completes.

The stack pointer adjustment must only be committed once it is certain that all of the stores will complete within triggerring any precise faults (stores may return imprecise bus errors which are received after the instruction has completed execution).

Referring to the example in <<push-example-1>> 

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
c.push  {ra, s0-s5}, -64
----

Appears to software as:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
# any bytes from SP-1 to SP-28 may be written multiple times before the instruction completes
sw  ra, -4(sp);   
sw  s0, -8(sp);

sw  s2,-16(sp);  
sw  s3,-20(sp);   
sw  s4,-24(sp);   
sw  s5,-28(sp);   

# this must only execute once, and will only execute after all stores complete sucessfully
addi sp, sp, -64; 
----

=== Software view of `POP[RET]` sequence

From a software perspective the `POP[RET]` sequence appears as:

* A sequence of loads, any of which may be executed multiple times
* A stack pointer adjustment
* An optional `RET`

If an implementation allows interrupts during the sequence, then any loads which were executed before the interrupt may update architectural state. The loads will be re-executed once the handler completes, so the values will be overwritten. Therefore it is permitted for an implementation to update some of the destination registers before taking the interrupt or other fault.

The stack pointer adjustment must only be committed once it is certain that all of the loads will complete successfully.

For `POPRET` once the stack pointer adjustment has been committed the `RET` must execute.

Referring to the example in <<popret-example-1>>

# must only execute once, will only execute after all loads complete successfully

== Initial benchmarking results

Using the `PUSH/POP` support in HCC (Huawei GCC branch) allows the full range of register lists in the 16-bit encodings, and up to 5-bits of `spimm`.

https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/ISA%20proposals/Huawei/push_pop_encoding_results.xlsx[This spreadsheet] shows the results across the whole benchmark suite to show which instructions were inferred (not broken down by benchmark).

The target for the 16-bit encodings has been to minimise encoding space while keeping ~ 95% of the cases on the benchmark suite (94.9% achieved)

The overall saving compared to -msave-restore is 4.8% using HCC (this result is subject to change as the benchmark suite is updated). Minimising the encoding space reduces this benefit to 4.6%.
