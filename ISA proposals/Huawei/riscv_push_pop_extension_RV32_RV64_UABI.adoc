This document describesï¼š

* 32-bit encodings for `PUSH/PUSH.[FDQ]`, `POP/POP.[FDQ]` and `POPRET/POPRET.[FDQ]`
* 16-bit encodings for `C.PUSH, C.POP` and `C.POPRET` instructions 

The instructions are defined for RV32, RV64 and RV128 architectures I variants only, using the UABI. 

Future revisions may include:

* The E variant
* EABI support

These instructions are to reduce the code-size of function prologues and epilogues by using a single encoding to replace a sequence of instructions. 
They are designed to replace common function prologue/epilogue sequences, but will not replace all possible cases. 

== Open issues

it's better to list these first, as they are resolved I'll update the proposal

* whether to allow an option of including `mv a0,s0` in `c.pop[ret]`
* allocate encodings for the 32-bit versions
* whether the fault handling should be profile defined

== Assembler Syntax

//these encodings may be 16-bit or 32-bit depending upon the parameters
push           {<rsreg_list>},[{<areg_list>},] -<stack_adjustment>
pop            {<rsreg_list>},[{ret_sreg},]     <stack_adjustment>

----

. The `PUSH` instruction 
** pushes(stores)  the registers specified in `rsreg_list` to the stack
** if `areg_list` is includes, moves the registers in the `areg_list` into `s` registers
** adjusts the stack pointer by the `stack_adjustment` 

. The `POP` instruction 
** pops(loads) the registers in `rsreg_list to the stack` from the stack
** if `ret_sreg` is included, moves the specified `s` register into `a0` as the return value
** adjusts the stack pointer by the `stack_adjustment`.

. `POPRET` has the same behaviour as `POP`, followed by `RET`.

pop.[fdq]      {<fsreg_list>},  <stack_adjustment> 
popret.[fdq]   {<fsreg_list>},  <stack_adjustment> 
----

These instructions allow `fs` registers to be pushed/popped and do not allow `areg_list` or `ret_sreg` to be specified (to save encoding space).

32-bit and 16-bit forms are available, the assembler should choose the 16-bit form if the parameters permit and the C extension is implemented.

The registers in `reg_list` and `areg_list` are comma separated lists and must not be empty.

For the 16-bit encodings

. In `reg_list`
.. `ra` must be included
.. `s0-sN` may be included, valid values of `N` are 0,1,2,3,5,8,11
.. `fs0-fsM` must not be included
. for `pop[ret], ret_sreg` must not be included *I may add an option for s0 in the 16-bit encoding TBD*
. Only specific combinations of `areg_list` and `sreg_list` are permitted
.. `if sreg_list={ra}:       areg_list={}`
.. `if sreg_list={ra,s0}:    areg_list={a0}`
.. `if sreg_list={ra,s0-sN}: areg_list={a0-a1} where N=2,3`
.. `if sreg_list={ra,s0-sN}: areg_list={a0-a2} where N=5,8,11`
. The `stack_adjustment` must be no more than the total memory required for `reg_list`, rounded up to a multiple of 16-bytes, plus an additional (0..7)*16-bytes.

Examples of valid 16-bit encodings for RV32 or RV64:

push   {ra,s0},    {a0},     -32; //store ra,s0;     mv s0,a0;                     decrement sp by 32
push   {ra,s0-s3}, {a0-a1},  -96; //store ra,s0-s3;  mv s0,a0; mv s1,a1;           decrement sp by 96
push   {ra,s0-s11},{a0-a2}, -128; //store ra,s0-s11; mv s0,a0; mv s1,a1; mv s2,a2; decrement sp by 128

pop    {ra},        16;  //load  ra;        increment sp by 16
popret {ra},        16;  //load  ra;        increment sp by 16; jump to ra

pop    {ra,s0},     32;  //load  ra,s0;     increment sp by 32
popret {ra,s0},     32;  //load  ra,s0;     increment sp by 32; jump to ra

pop    {ra,s0-s3},  96;  //load  ra,s0-s3;  increment sp by 96
popret {ra,s0-s3},  96;  //load  ra,s0-s3;  increment sp by 96; jump to ra

pop    {ra,s0-s11}, 128; //load  ra,s0-s11; increment sp by 128
popret {ra,s0-s11}, 128; //load  ra,s0-s11; increment sp by 128; jump to ra

----
[NOTE]
  There is no encoding space in the 16-bit encoding to explicitly specify `areg_list` so it is automatically determined from the `reg_list` value based on analysing usage in the benchmark suite


[NOTE]
  To save encoding space some opcodes do not allow the full range of `spimm` or `reg_list` which reduces the possible `stack adjustment` range further, see <<#16bitencodings>>

For the 32-bit encodings

. The `stack_adjustment` must be no more than the total memory required for `reg_list`, rounded up to a multiple of 16-bytes, plus an additional (0..15)*16-bytes.

For example

. `push   {ra,s0-s2}, {a0-a1}, -64` can use a 16-bit encoding
. `push   {s0-s2},    {a0-a1}, -64` must use a 32-bit encoding as `ra` is not in the register list
. `push   {ra,s0-s2}, {a0-a1}, -256` must use a 32-bit encoding as the `stack_adjustment` is out of range
. `push   {ra,s0-s2},          -32` must use a 32-bit encoding as `sreg_list` requires `areg_list={a0-a1}` for the 16-bit encoding
. `push.f {ra,s0-s2, fs0},     -64` must use a 32-bit encoding as `fs0` is in the register list
. `pop    {ra,s0-s2}, {s0},     32` must use a 23-bit encoding as `s0` is the `ret_sreg` register

To be a legal encoding:

1.  The stack adjustment must be negative for all `PUSH` variants and positive for all `POP[RET]` variants
2.  The stack adjustment must be in range (see <<spimm>>) and must be a multiple of 16
3.  The register lists must be valid (see above)
4.  If any `f` registers are included in the list there must be an `.[fdq]` suffix
5.  It there is an `.[fdq]` suffix, there must be `f` registers in the list
6.  It there is an `.[fdq]` suffix, `areg_list` must not be included in the synax
7.  For `POPRET` variants, `rsreg_list` must include `ra`
8.  `areg_list` must not be included for all `POP` and `POPRET` variants and for `PUSH.[FDQ]`

Additionally:

. If `sp` is not 16-byte aligned then take an illegal instruction exception

[NOTE]
  When moving from loading or storing `x` registers to `f` registers there may be a gap as the registers may be different widths, and all registers must be aligned in memory

== Determining XLEN and FLEN to decode and execute the instructions

The width of `x` registers in the register list depends upon XLEN and so `misa.MXL`. From the ELF file header, XLEN is determined by the following flags:

* ELFCLASS64 for RV64
* ELFCLASS32 for RV32 

[NOTE]

  I don't think there's an ELFCLASS128 for RV128

If using a debugger then `misa.MXL` can be read, if XLEN is not known for the core.

FLEN is explicitly specified in the opcode as the presence of any `f` registers requires a `.[fdq]` suffix on the opcode.

Follow this link for details of the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md#file-header[ELF file header]

=== Rationale: why include the .[fdq] suffix

It is required to hard-code the length of the `f` registers in the opcode, and not just save/restore the whole register. We must allow code compiled for the F-extension
to run on a  core which supports D and possibly Q. We must also allow code compiled for the D-extension to run on a core which supports Q.

If we don't explicitly state the `f` register width and always store the whole register, then the registers will be stored at different addresses to the ones expected 
by the compiler. 

An alternative would be to use `misa.[FDQ]`
to directly control the behaviour and so set `misa.[DQ]=0` when running F code. Nothing else in the architecture requires this, so it seems unreasonable to 
add this requirement here.

== Pseudo-code

The pseudo-code below show the required architectural state updates. 

Note that every architectural state update in the pseudo-code can be executed as a standard RISC-V 32-bit encoding, so that it is possible execute the instructions as sequences of standard instructions. 

Because the pseudo-code includes load or store operations, they may take any fault caused by executing loads or stores. See <<fault-handling>> for more details.

=== PUSH Pseudo-code

All variants of the `PUSH` instruction store the set of registers from `reg_list` to consecutive memory locations, and decrement the stack pointer.
The pseudo-code uses assembly inserts so that it can use `fsw/fsd` etc.

The pseudo-code shows the memory and architectural state updates of the whole instruction which has completed without faults, debug halts or interrupts. See <<fault-handling>> and <<software-view>> for more information.

[NOTE]
  `stack_adjustment` is negative.

----

=== POP[RET] Pseudo-code

A `POP[RET]` instruction loads the set of registers from `reg_list` from consecutive memory locations, and then increments the stack pointer. 
The pseudo-code uses assembly inserts so that it can use `flw/fld/ret`.

The pseudo-code shows the architectural state updates of the whole instruction which has completed without faults, debug halts or interrupts. See <<fault-handling>> and <<software-view>> for more information.

[NOTE]
  `stack_adjustment` is positive.

|============================================================================

[NOTE]
  bits [28:27] are the `flen` field
  `ra=1` for all `popret` encodings, if [26]=0 the encoding is *reserved*

=== Illegal instructions for the 32-bit encodings

The encoding takes the same behaviour as any floating point instruction if executed when disabled:

* if `frcount>0` and `misa.F==0`
* if `frcount>0` and `flen==1` and `misa.D==0`
* if `frcount>0` and `flen==2` and `misa.Q==0`

The following cases do not decode as `PUSH*/POP*/POPRET*`

* No registers are specified (`rcount, frcount` are both zero)
* `rcount>14`
* `flen=3`
* `rcount==13` and `frcount>0` and opcode doesn't have an `[fdq]` suffix

==== Rational: `rcount=13, frcount=0` saving all saved regsiters

The debian distro does save all `s` and `fs` registers on a few occasions, so I used a special encoding for this case. I saw no justification for saving all `fs` registers *without* saving all `s` registers. It seems useful to have a form which saves all saved registers.

The programmable range for `frcount` doesn't save many `fs` registers as `FPMark` only saves one or two and Debian rarely saves more than that.

== Encoding Fields

[#spimm]
=== `spimm` encoding field

The `stack_adjustment` field in the assembly syntax comprises of two components:

. the memory required for the registers in the list, rounded up to 16-bytes (using the `Align16` function below)
. additional stack space allocated for local variables, encoded in the `spimm` field

The 16-bit encoding allows up to 7 additional 16-byte blocks (as `spimm` has up to 3-bits), and the 32-bit encoding allows up to 31.

[NOTE]
  we may change the size of `spimm` in the 32-bit encoding once benchmarking work has completed

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
//the padding calculation requires SP to be 16-byte aligned before executing the instruction
if (FLEN>XLEN && 
    number_of_registers_in_freg_list>0 && 
    number_of_registers_in_reg_list % (FLEN/XLEN)>0) {
  //need padding to ensure FLEN registers are aligned
  padding = (FLEN/XLEN - number_of_registers_in_reg_list % (FLEN/XLEN)) * XLEN/8;
} else {
  padding = 0
}
total_register_bytes = number_of_registers_in_reg_list * XLEN/8 + padding + number_of_registers_in_freg_list * FLEN/8;
stack_adjustment = Align16(total_register_bytes) + 16*spimm;
----

The bytes required for padding is simple - if FLEN==XLEN it's always zero. If FLEN=2*XLEN it is 0 or 4. RV32Q is more complex (see below) but this is an unlikely configuration.
`n` is an integer in the tables so `2n` is always even, `2n+1` is always odd.

[#fault-handling]
== Fault handling

The sequence required to execute the instruction may be interrupted, or may not be able to start execution for several reasons.

* virtual memory page fault or PMP fault
** these can be detected before execution, or during execution if the memory addresses cross a page/PMP boundary
* watchpoint trigger
** these can be detected before execution, or during execution depending on the trigger type (load data triggers require the sequence to have started executing, for example)
* external debug halt
** the halt can treat the whole sequence atomically, or interrupt mid sequence (implementation defined)
* debug halt caused by a trigger
** same comment as watchpoint trigger above
* load access fault
** these are detected while the sequence is executing
* store access fault (precise or imprecise)
** these may be detected while the sequence is executing, or afterwards if imprecise
* interrupts
** these may arrive at any time. An implementation can choose whether to interrupt the sequence or not.

Because some faults can only be detected during the sequence the core implementation is able to recover from the fault and re-execute the sequence. This may involve executing some or all of the loads and stores from the sequence multiple times before the sequence completes (as multiple faults or multiple interrupts are possible).

Therefore correct execution requires that `sp` refers to idempotent memory.

[#software-view]
== Software view of execution

=== Software view of `PUSH` sequence

From a software perspective the `PUSH` sequence appears as:

* A sequence of stores writing a contiguous block of memory. Any of the bytes may be written multiple times.
* A stack pointer adjustment

Because the memory is idempotent and the stores are non-overlapping, they may be reordered, grouped into larger accesses, split into smaller access or any combination of these.

If an implementation allows interrupts during the sequence, and the interrupt handler uses `sp` to allocate stack memory, then any stores which were executed before the interrupt maybe be overwritten by the handler. This is safe because the memory is idempotent and the stores will be re-executed once the handler completes.

The stack pointer adjustment must only be committed once it is certain that all of the stores will complete within triggerring any precise faults (stores may return imprecise bus errors which are received after the instruction has completed execution).

Referring to the example in <<push-example-1>>

sw  s2,-16(sp);  
sw  s3,-20(sp);   
sw  s4,-24(sp);   
sw  s5,-28(sp);   

# these must only execute once, and will only execute after all stores complete sucessfully
mv s0, a0;
mv s1, a1;
mv s2, a2;
addi sp, sp, -64; 
----

=== Software view of `POP[RET]` sequence

From a software perspective the `POP[RET]` sequence appears as:

* A sequence of loads, any of which may be executed multiple times
* A stack pointer adjustment
* An optional `RET`

If an implementation allows interrupts during the sequence, then any loads which were executed before the interrupt may update architectural state. The loads will be re-executed once the handler completes, so the values will be overwritten. Therefore it is permitted for an implementation to update some of the destination registers before taking the interrupt or other fault.

The register moves and stack pointer adjustment must only be committed once it is certain that all of the loads will complete successfully.

For `POPRET` once the stack pointer adjustment has been committed the `RET` must execute.

Referring to the example in <<popret-example-1>> 

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
popret   {ra, s0-s3}, {s1}, 32 ;

[source,sourceCode,text]

lw   s3, 12(sp);
flw  fs0, 8(sp);
flw  fs1, 4(s0);

# must only execute once, will only execute after all loads complete successfully
# all instructions must execute atomically
