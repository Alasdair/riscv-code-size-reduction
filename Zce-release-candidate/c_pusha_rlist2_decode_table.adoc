Field decoding::

The mapping from the _rlist2_ field in the encoding are as shown below.

_stack_adj_base_ is the minimum number of bytes, in multiples of 16-byte blocks, required to store the registers in _reg_list_2_4_. 

_spimm_ is the number of additional 16-byte blocks allocated for the stack frame.

The total stack adjustment is calculated as shown.

stack_adj = stack_adj_base+spimm[5:4]*16

Prerequisites::
The C-extension must also be configured.

32-bit equivalent::
No direct equivalent encoding exists
