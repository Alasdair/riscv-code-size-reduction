    { bits:  6, name: 'config',    attr: ['CONFIGURATION'] },

Description::

_TBLJALVEC.base_ is a virtual address, whenever virtual memory is enabled.

Using _TBLJALVEC.base[5:0]_ is implicitly zero, and is naturally aligned for all legal values of _XLEN_.

The memory pointed to by _TBLJALVEC.base_ only requires eXecute permission. Read/Write access is not required once the jump table/vector 
table has been configured. If code is to be emulated then Read access is also required, but the table jump instructions themselves don't require this.

|=============================================================================================

_TBLJALVEC.config_ is a WARL field, so can only be programmed to modes which are implemented. Therefore the discovery mechanism is to 
attempt to program different modes and read back the values to see which are available. Jump table mode _must_ be implemented.
