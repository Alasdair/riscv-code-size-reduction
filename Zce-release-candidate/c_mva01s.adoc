Synopsis::
Move two s0-s7 registers into a0-a1

Mnemonic::
c.mva01s

Encoding (RV32, RV64)::

....
{reg:[
    { bits:  2, name: 0x2,      attr: [] },
    { bits:  3, name: 'sreg2',  attr: [] },
    { bits:  2, name: 0x3,      attr: [] },

    { bits:  6, name: 0x2b,     attr: ['FUNCT6'] },

Assembly Syntax::

[source,sail]
--
c.mva01s sreg1, sreg2
--

Description::
This instruction moves _sreg1_ into _a0_ and _sreg2_ into _a1_. 
The execution is atomic, so it is not possible to observe state where only one of _a0_ or _a1_ have been updated.

The encoding has uses _sreg_ number specifiers instead of _xreg_ number specifiers to save encoding space. 
The mapping between them is specified in the pseudo-code below.

[NOTE]

  The _s_ register mapping is taken from the UABI, and may not match the currently unratified EABI. _c.mva01s.e_ may be included in the future.

Prerequisites::
The C-extension must also be configured.

32-bit equivalent::
No direct equivalent encoding exists.

Operation::

//This is not SAIL, it's pseudo-code. The SAIL hasn't been written yet.

xreg1 = {sreg1[2:1]>0,sreg1[2:1]==0,sreg1[2:0]}
xreg2 = {sreg2[2:1]>0,sreg2[2:1]==0,sreg2[2:0]}

X[10] = X[xreg1]
X[11] = X[xreg2]
