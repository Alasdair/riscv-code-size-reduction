=== c.mva01s07

Synopsis::
Move two s0-s7 registers into a0-a1, 16-bit encoding

Mnemonic::
c.mva01s07 _sreg1, sreg2_

Encoding (RV32, RV64, RV128)::
[wavedrom, , svg]
....
{reg:[
    { bits:  2, name: 0x1,      attr: ['OP=C1'] },
    { bits:  3, name: 'sreg2',  attr: [] },
    { bits:  2, name: 0x3,      attr: [] },
    { bits:  3, name: 'sreg1',  attr: [] },
    { bits:  8, name: 0x27,     attr: ['FUNCT6'] },
],config:{bits:16}}
....

Syntax::

[source,sail]
--
c.mva01s07 sreg1, sreg2
--

Description::
This instruction moves _sreg1_ into _a0_ and _sreg2_ into _a1_. 
The execution is atomic, so it is not possible to observe state where only one of a0 or a1 have been updated.

The encoding has two _sreg_ number specifiers to save encoding space. 

[NOTE]

  This instruction does not directly expand to a single 32-bit encoding.

[NOTE]

  The _s_ register mapping is taken from the UABI, and may not match the currently unratified EABI.

Prerequisites::
The C-extension must also be configured.

32-bit equivalent::
No direct equivalent encoding exists.
