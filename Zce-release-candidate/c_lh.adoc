Description::
This instruction loads a half-word from the memory address formed by adding _rs1'_ to the zero extended immediate _uimm_. The resulting half-word is sign extended to XLEN bits and is written to _rd'_. 
Both operands are from the 8-register set x8-x15.

Prerequisites::
The C-extension. This encoding conflicts with the D-extension, but there is no conflict with Zdinx if double-precision arithmetic is required.

Operation::
[source,sail]
