[NOTE]

  All ABI register mapping are for the UABI. An EABI version is planned once the EABI is frozen.

For further information see <<insns-pushpop>>.

Field decoding::

The mapping from the _rlist3_ and _spimm_ fields in the encoding are as shown below.

_stack_adj_base_ covers enough 16-byte blocks of memory to cover the registers in _reg_list_5_13_. 

_spimm_ is used to allocate extra stack space in 16-byte blocks. 

The total stack adjustment is calculated as shown.

stack_adj = stack_adj_base+spimm[6:4]*16

Prerequisites::
The C-extension must also be configured.

32-bit equivalent::
No direct equivalent encoding exists.
