Synopsis::
Store byte, 16-bit encoding

Mnemonic::
c.sb _r2'_, _uimm_(_rs1'_)

Encoding (RV32, RV64, RV128)::
[wavedrom, svg]
....
{reg:[
    { bits:  2, name: 0x0, attr: ['C0'] },
    { bits:  3, name: 'rs2\'' },
    { bits:  2, name: 'uimm[2:1]' },
    { bits:  3, name: 'rs1\'\'' },
    { bits:  2, name: 'uimm[4:3]' },
    { bits:  1, name: 0x0},
    { bits:  3, name: 0x5, attr: ['FUNCT3'] },
],config:{bits:16}}
....

Description::
This instruction stores the least significant half of _rs2'_ to the memory address formed by adding _rs1''_ to the zero extended immediate _uimm_. 

[NOTE]
  _rs2'_ is from the standard 8-register set x8-x15. _rs1''_ replaces x12 (a2) with x2 (sp) for additional code size saving. Therefore the 8-register set is x8-x11,x2,x13-x15.

Prerequisites::
The C-extension. This encoding conflicts with the D-extension, but there is no conflict with Zdinx if double-precision arithmetic is required.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
//This is not SAIL, it's pseudo-code. The SAIL hasn't been written yet.

rs2   = encoding[9:7]+8;
rs1   = encoding[4:2]==4 ? 2 : 8+encoding[4:2];
mem[X(rs1)+zext(uimm)][7:0] = X(rs2)
