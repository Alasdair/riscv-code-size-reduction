Welcome to the RISC-V Code Size Reduction Group
------------------------------------------------

_If you can't measure it you can't improve it_

This is the current stable proposal for reducing code size:

- [Zc ISA proposal](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/releases/tag/V0.70.1-TOOLCHAIN-DEV)

For details of analysing the `Zc` code-size reduction extensions against your ELF file look here

- [Analysis script](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/tree/master/benchmarks)

This is the current set of benchmark results from the analysis script:
