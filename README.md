Welcome to the RISC-V Code Size Reduction Group
------------------------------------------------


This will be the home for the all of the code size reduction proposals, analysis, results etc.

Currently I have documented the Huawei Custom Extension for reducing code size, which is already in silicon. I'd like to use this as the basis for a future RISC-V code size reduction extension.
