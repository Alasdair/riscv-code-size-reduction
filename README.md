Current open issues to discuss in meetings
------------------------------------------

- How to report code size, Ofer suggests total size of all read-only sections in the elf file
- Whether synopsys would be interested in letting us compare against Metaware for ARC v2, or if we should just keep it to open source (ARC v1). In general comparisons should be against open source compilers except where we have specific support, i.e. IAR
- Review of push/pop proposal and how to handle the EABI cases
  - different meaning of register lists (different X registers from s2 onwards), and how to specify them in the assembler syntax
  - different stack alignment 8 / 16-bytes
  - selecting either ABI in software for I (32-reg) architectures
  
Reference Architectures
-----------------------

These are architectures we could compare against. The "official" comparison architectures have not yet been decided, but almost certainly need freely available ISA manuals and GCC+LLVM ports

- ARMv7-M / Cortex-M3 [manual is here](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0403/ed/)
- ARCv1 / ARC700 [manual is here](http://me.bios.io/images/d/dd/ARCompactISA_ProgrammersReference.pdf) _ARCv2 would be better but is proprietary (ISA and toolchain)_
- NanoMIPs [manual is here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/downloads-mips/I7200/I7200+product+launch/MIPS_nanomips32_ISA_TRM_01_01_MD01247.pdf) see "save" instruction on page 163 and "restore/restore.js" instructions on page 155

Code size reduction ideas
-------------------------

Need a lot more detail for these, they're just placeholders at the moment

- runtime library optimisation
- link time optimisation including dead code elimination
- function prologue/epilogue optimisation in software, to close the gap with the PUSH/POP ISA extension proposal
- smaller instruction sequences to jump to distant addresses
- smaller instruction sequences to load/store to distant addresses
- smaller instruction sequences to load 32-bit constants
- load/store multiple
  - specified as a register list, or as base register and register count?
  - what's best for the compiler? base + count could probably fit in a 16-bit encoding
- additional 16-bit encodings representing common 32-bit instructions, for example
  - load/store byte/half
  - sign/zero extend byte/half (as suggested by Anders below)
  - not (XOR rs, -1), neg (SUB rs, x0, rs) (suggested by B-extension).
  - mul, and shift-then-or (rd|=ra<<n) with shift distances of 8/16/24 (useful for Huawei IoT code)
  - store byte/half of zero to the stack pointer
  - store byte/half/word of zero
- ADD instruction(s) with a carry out for chaining into longer ADDs (Matteo)
  - add sl, xl, yl              -> implicitly save the carry bit     
  - addH sh, xh, yh        <- implicitly add the carry bit
  - But I don't know if outside the soft-float FP functions we would have significant gains.


From Anders Lindgren:

- Better support for 8 and 16 bit data
	
  - Today, most RISC-V instructions work on the full registers. This makes the generated code more efficient to handle 32 bit data than 8 and 16 bit data. Effectively, the compiler must ensure that 8 and 16 bit data are properly extended before it can perform things like compares on them. To make things worse, RISC-V doesn't provide instructions to perform extensions so typically two instructions are needed to perform extensions (with the exception of 8 bit zero extension which can be done using "ANDI Rd, Rs, 0xFF"). Instructions to perform sign and zero extend (preferably with compact variants) are obvious candidates. In addition, we could consider 8 and 16 bit variants (and for RV64 32 bit variants) for various instructions like compare, right shift, division, and modulo. One thing that makes the situation worse is that the ABI requires arguments and return values to be correctly extended. Hence a small function like "short f(short x, short y) { return x + y; }" require 4 instructions (add, shift left, signed shift right, ret). I would like to see if the overall code size would shrink if the ABI didn't require this, and, if so, recommend that the EABI (which isn't ratified) is changed to that fewer extension instructions are needed.

- Insert and extract parts of registers

  - If it would be easier to insert and extract parts of registers, we could avoid storing things on the stack. Concretely, a RV32 processor register could be used to store four bytes or two halfwords.

- Improved compare with constants

  - Today, when comparing a value against a non-zero constant, at least two instructions are needed. Instructions that compare a register against commonly used constants (imm5?) could reduce code size. We need to see which constants and which comparisons are most effective.
   - See [this proposal for combined compare-immediate-branch](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_condbr_imm_extension.rst)

- Address calculations with scaling

  - In C, when doing address calculations, the index value is scaled with the object size to produce the end address. Today, this is done using an explicit shift (when the size of the object is a power of two) or a multiplication. We should look into loads, stores, and load-effective-address with this scaling builtin. Since most arrays use elements of size 2, 4, and 8 we could restrict ourselves to this.

48-bit encodings
----------------

The Huawei custom extension includes one 48-bit encoding to load a 32-bit constant, the proposal is [here](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_LLI_extension.rst)

nanoMIPs includes 48-bit encodings for
- load immediate from 32-bit constant `LI48`
- add 32-bit constant to register `ADDIU48, ADDIUGP48`
- add 32-bit constant to the PC `ADDIUPC48`
- load/store word PC relative with 32-bit offset `LWPC48, SWPC48`



Experiments
-----------

- enable B-extension, maybe a subset could become part of a future code-size reduction ISA extension

Outputs from the group
----------------------

- Improved open source compiler technology (GCC and LLVM)
  - code size optimised compilers with and without `Zce` (see below)
  - for example function prologue/epilogue should be smaller than _-msave-restore_ is now in GCC. 
- One code size reduction extension, maybe called `Zce` which is likely to be broken into sections
  - Zce_base - all 32-bit, non-multiple step code size reduction instructions possibly including some of the B-extension
  - Zce_48 - 48-bit encodings - we shouldn't force people to implement these (and still need to justify them)
  - Zce_16 - 16-bit encodings - because if you don't specify C these must be excluded
    - maybe this is not neccessary as (e.g.) the F extension includes 16-bit encodings which are only available if C is enabled, and Zce will follow suit
  - Zce_multistep - encodings which require multiple steps (UOPs) e.g. push/pop, not everyone will want to implement these
