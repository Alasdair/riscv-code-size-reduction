The download includes HCC which has the Huawei custom instructions included, e.g. 48-bit L.LI so you can try them out (using –femit-lli)
Download the release with the highest SPC number to get the latest version.
 
This link shows the custom instructions that we use:

Note that the current build scripts use –fldm-stm-optimize and –msave-restore. These arguments should be ideally be removed and replaced with –mpush-pop.
