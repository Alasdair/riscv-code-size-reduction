Hi3861 Huawei WiFi Iot SDK
---------------------------


First you need to create a login at hihope.org/login, the page is in Chinese.

![login1](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/benchmarks/Hi3861_WiFi_IoT/pic1.jpg)

Click on the two yellow characters to get to the signup page

![login2](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/benchmarks/Hi3861_WiFi_IoT/pic2.jpg)

Create a login and click on register, and then login on the previous page.


And when that’s worked you can go to the download page

Click on HI3861V100

You can download HCC (you can see it in the picture) which has the Huawei custom instructions included, e.g. 48-bit L.LI so you can try them out (using –femit-lli)
Download the release with the highest SPC number to get the latest version.
 
This link shows the custom instructions that we use:

https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/existing_extensions/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/README.md
 
Note that the current build scripts use –fldm-stm-optimize and –msave-restore. These arguments should be ideally be removed and replaced with –mpush-pop.
The output elf is here:

Building in Linux
---------------------------
To compile the source code in Linux:

A) Place the compiler in a direcotry called hcc_riscv32, and add the bin subdirectory of the compiler the PATH variable
B) Install any version of scons newer than 3.0.1 and install any version of python newer than 3.7 
C) Change the following files:
   1) build/scripts/scons_env_cfg.py:
                                 env_path_param = os.environ['PATH'].split(';') to be changed to  env_path_param = os.environ['PATH'].split(':') 
                                 compiler = os.path.join(param, 'riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc.exe') to compiler = os.path.join(param, 'riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc')
   2) build/scripts/sconts_utils.py:
                                 env_path_param = os.environ['PATH'].split(';') to be changed to  env_path_param = os.environ['PATH'].split(':') 
                                 compiler = os.path.join(param, 'riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc.exe') to compiler = os.path.join(param, 'riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc')
   3) tools/nvtools/build_nv.py:
                                 g_nv_env.nv_tool=os.path.join(root_dir, 'tools', 'nv', 'cdbm.exe') to  g_nv_env.nv_tool=os.path.join(root_dir, 'tools', 'nv', 'cdbm')
D) Run ./build.sh

Note 2: to obtain identical results to the one reported, the optimization flag need to be changed from -O2 to -Os
