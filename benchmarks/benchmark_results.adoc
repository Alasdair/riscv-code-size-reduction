## Zce Code saving estimation criteria 


# Benchmarking Background: 
This document present benchmarking results for Zce extension, baseline files were compiled using https://buildbot.embecosm.com/job/riscv32-gcc-ubuntu1804-release/5/artifact/riscv32-embecosm-ubuntu1804-gcc10.2.0-r4.tar.gz[gcc10.2.0-r4] with -Os and -msave-restore unless otherwise specified. All results are generated from static analysis, and
file sizes are calculated based on parsed instruction sizes of the ELF files, and the optimised sizes are calculated based on parsed instruction with relevant Zce instructions. 



# Zcec Subset: 

## C.TBLJAL
.. Find all (JAL, JALR, J and JR) instructions to be considered for replacement.
.. Remove entries that we won't gain any code saving from substituting, When number of identical (JAL or J) <  3.
.. Change the weight of JALR and JR entries to 3*Count (This would give them priority in selection, since their replacement results in more code saving).
.. Get the top 512 entries, evaluation of other lengths  xref:#shorter-table-length-for-tbljal[here].
.. Replace the entries in instruction record with the TBLJAL entries, and calculate the gains and compensate for the table size.

.. Replace all instructions that fit the replacement criteria with the correct push instruction 

## C.POP and C.POPRET 
.. Traverse functions in reverse starting from epilogue
.. Find positive stack adjustments 
.. Find all stack relative  Load words that has positive offsets and fit within the range 
.. Stop search at HOBs 
.. Check what is the maximum number of registers that we can fit in our replacement criteria
.. Replace all instructions that fit the replacement criteria with the correct POP/POPRET instruction 


For this to work, we need to run the script across files compiled without msave-restore, so it can find the actual stack adjustments, loads and stores instead of calls to msave-restore routines. 

In the table below, the potential saving from running the script across files with no m-msave-restore are titled as NO_MSR_Savings. For fair relative comparison with other optimisations, these results are also presented to file sizes compiled with msave-restore:
