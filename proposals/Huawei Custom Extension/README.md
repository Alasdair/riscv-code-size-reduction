Huawei Custom Extension
-----------------------

here are the specifications for instructions to reduce code size, which are currently available on silicon:

# [16-bit push/pop](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/proposals/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_push_pop_extension.rst)
# [32-bit compare immediate branch](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/proposals/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_condbr_imm_extension.rst)
# [32-bit long jump](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/proposals/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_longjump_extension.rst)
# [32-bit multiply immediate add](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/proposals/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_muladd_extension.rst)
# [32-bit preshifted arithmetic](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/proposals/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_preshifted_arithmetic.rst)
# [48-bit load long immediate](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/proposals/Huawei%20Custom%20Extension/riscv_LLI_extension.rst)

As noted in the documents, the 16-bit push/pop instructions and the 32-bit long jump instructions may need modification before being used as proposals for the new RISC-V extension.
