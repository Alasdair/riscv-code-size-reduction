RISC-V 32-bit Conditional Branch Compare Immediate Extension
============================================================

These instructions are included in the Huawei custom RISCV extension, and are implemented on silicon.

Rationale
---------

When ARMv7-M code needs to take a conditional branch based upon a register value and a small constant, 
it requires 4-bytes of instructions. For example:

.. code-block:: text

  cmp r3, #2

  beq.n <offset>

because the cmp instruction implicitly sets the condition code flags the ``beq.n`` instruction does not need to 
specify a source register. 

The equivalent RISC-V code is like this:

.. code-block:: text

  c.li a2,#2

  beq a4, a2, <offset>

requiring 6-bytes of instructions.

This sequence occurs thousands of times in the Huawei IoT code, so the proposal is to add immediate forms of the 
32-bit condition branch instructions. For example:

``beqi a4, #2, <offset>``

which requires a single 32-bit encoding, and so is the same size as the ARMv7-M code.

According to code analysis, this sequence is by far most common for ``beq``, ``bne`` and is rare for other types of 
conditional branch instructions. There are 15 bits of immediate value available in the encoding space 
(bit 0 of the branch offset is not required). The optimum assignments are


1.	Allow an 8-bit immediate value

    a)	Compare register value against values -128 to +127 (signed) or 0 to +255 (unsigned)

2.	Allow a 10-bit branch offset (bit 0 isnâ€™t stored)

    b)	Allows branches to PC-512 to PC+510

These instructions are implemented in the RISC-V HCC toolchain, this is the internal Huawei branch of GCC including the Huawei custom instructions

- enabled with -fimm-compare
- saves 0.89% of Huawei IoT code size

The full set needed to be implemented to allow HCC to infer the instructions, even though some are clearly of limited value.

LE(U) and GT(U) are not included as they can be achieved by modifying the immediate by 1.

For example 

-	a <= 2 can be transformed to a < 3 and use BLTI
-	a > 2 can be transformed to a >= 1 and use BGEI

----------------

``beqi	r1, #1, <offset>	// if r1 == 	sign_ext(cmpimm) branch to PC+offset``

``bnei	r1, #1, <offset>	// if r1 != 	sign_ext(cmpimm) branch to PC+offset``

``blti	r1, #1, <offset>	// if r1 <  	sign_ext(cmpimm) branch to PC+offset``

``bgei	r1, #1, <offset>	// if r1 >= 	sign_ext(cmpimm) branch to PC+offset``

``bltui	r1, #1, <offset>	// if r1 <u  	zero_ext(cmpimm) branch to PC+offset``

``bgeui	r1, #1, <offset>	// if r1 >=u  zero_ext(cmpimm) branch to PC+offset``
