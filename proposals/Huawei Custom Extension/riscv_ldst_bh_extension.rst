RISC-V 16-bit Load/Store Byte/Half Extension Proposal
=====================================================

These instructions are included in the Huawei custom RISCV extension

Rationale
---------

The RISC-V C extension supports ``c.lw``, ``c.sw`` but it does not support 16-bit encodings of smaller data types. 
Analysis has shown that ``c.lbu`` , ``c.sb`` (load byte unsigned, store byte), and ``c.lhu`` , ``c.sh`` give a significant benefit to code size, as shown below.

Signed byte / half loads give minimal benefit and so are not proposed.

``c.lbu`` , ``c.sb`` are implemented in the RISC-V HCC toolchain, this is the internal Huawei branch of GCC including the Huawei custom instructions

-  enabled with *–Wa,-enable-c-lbu-sb*
-  saves 2.11% of Huawei IoT code size

``c.lhu`` , ``c.sh`` are implemented in the RISC-V HCC toolchain

-  enabled with *-Wa,-enable-c-lhu-sh*
-  saves 1.57% of Huawei IoT code size

*These are my personal measurements and do not agree with the results in the paper, we need to generate a set of figures which we agree upon, across multiple code bases*

These encodings replace double precision floating point load/stores in the compressed encoding space.
Other encodings are difficult to find as the immediate is quite long for the instructions to be useful.
It is acknowledged that cores supporting the D-extension will miss out on the benefit of these instructions.
I believe that the only way to have versions of these instructions with an immediate value long enough to be useful and the D-extension at the same time would be to make a new version of the C-extension, but I'm happy to be proved wrong.

.. code-block:: text

  c.lbu: 	x[8+rd’] = zero_extend(M[x[8+rs1’] + uimm][7:0])
  c.lhu: 	x[8+rd’] = zero_extend(M[x[8+rs1’] + uimm][15:0])
  c.sb :	M[x[8+rs1’] + uimm][7:0] 	= x[8+rs2’]
  c.sh :	M[x[8+rs1’] + uimm][15:0] 	= x[8+rs2’]

``uimm[0]`` is implicitly zero for ``c.lhu`` / ``c.sh``.

Note that the registers are all in the range x8-x15 (s0-1, a0-5). The compiler should be aware of this restriction and optimise the register allocation 
to allow for these registers to be selected, so that the 16-bit encodings are selected more often.

Assembler Syntax
----------------

.. code-block:: text

  c.lbu  s0,5(a1)  // load zero extended byte from address a1+5
  c.sb   s1,6(a1)  // store s1[7:0] to address a1+6
  c.lhu  s0,10(a1) // load zero extended half-word from address a1+10
  c.sh   s1,12(a1) // store s1[15:0] to address a1+12
