RISC-V 16-bit Load/Store Byte/Half Extension
============================================

Rationale
---------

The RISC-V C extension supports ``c.lw``, ``c.sw`` but it does not support 16-bit encodings of smaller data types. 
Analysis has shown that ``c.lbu`` , ``c.sb`` (load byte unsigned, store byte), and ``c.lhu`` , ``c.sh`` give a significant benefit to the code size. 
In the Hi2120 NB-IoT code base the benefit of the byte instructions is roughly double the benefit of the half-word instructions.

Signed byte / half loads give minimal benefit and so are not proposed.

``c.lbu`` , ``c.sb`` are implemented in the RISC-V HCC toolchain

-  enabled with *–Wa,-enable-c-lbu-sb*
-  save 1.5% of NB-IoT code size

``c.lhu`` , ``c.sh`` are implemented in the RISC-V HCC toolchain

-  enabled with *-Wa,-enable-c-lhu-sh*
-  save 0.7% of NB-IoT code size

These instructions are already implemented in HiMiDeerSV100 and HiMiDeerV200

These encodings replace double precision floating point load/stores in the compressed encoding space.

.. code-block:: text

  c.lbu: 	x[8+rd’] = zero_extend(M[x[8+rs1’] + uimm][7:0])
  c.lhu: 	x[8+rd’] = zero_extend(M[x[8+rs1’] + uimm][15:0])
  c.sb :	M[x[8+rs1’] + uimm][7:0] 	= x[8+rs2’]
  c.sh :	M[x[8+rs1’] + uimm][15:0] 	= x[8+rs2’]

``uimm[0]`` is implicitly zero for ``c.lhu`` / ``c.sh``.

Note that the registers are all in the range x8-x15 (s0-1, a0-5). The compiler should be aware of this restriction and optimise the register allocation 
to allow for these registers to be selected, so that the 16-bit encodings are selected more often.

Also note that the code size savings above are without fixing the register allocation in the compiler, so greater savings are possible.

Assembler Syntax
----------------

.. code-block:: text

  c.lbu  s0,5(a1)  // load zero extended byte from address a1+5
  c.sb   s1,6(a1)  // store s1[7:0] to address a1+6
  c.lhu  s0,10(a1) // load zero extended half-word from address a1+10
  c.sh   s1,12(a1) // store s1[15:0] to address a1+12
