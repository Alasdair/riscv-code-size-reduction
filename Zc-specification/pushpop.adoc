== PUSH/POP register instructions

These instructions are collectively referred to as PUSH/POP: 

* <<#insns-cm_push>> 
* <<#insns-cm_pop>> 
* <<#insns-cm_popret>> 
* <<#insns-cm_popretz>> 

The term PUSH refers to _cm.push_.

The term POP refers to _cm.pop_.

The term POPRET refers to _cm.popret and cm.popretz_.

Common details for these instructions are in this section.

=== PUSH/POP functional overview

PUSH, POP, POPRET are used to reduce the size of function prologues and epilogues.

. The PUSH instruction
** pushes (stores) the registers specified in the register list to the stack frame
** adjusts the stack pointer to create the stack frame

. The POP instruction
** pops (loads) the registers in the register list from the stack frame
** adjusts the stack pointer to destroy the stack frame

. The POPRET instructions
** pop (load) the registers in the register list from the stack from
** _cm.popretz_ also moves zero into _a0_ as the return value
** adjust the stack pointer  to destroy the stack frame
** execute a _ret_ instruction to return from the function

The prologue / epilogue reduce from 60-bytes in the original code, to 14-bytes with _-msave-restore_, 
and to 4-bytes with PUSH and POPRET. 
As well as reducing the code-size PUSH and POPRET eliminate the branches from 
calling the millicode _save/restore_ routines and so may also perform better. 
  
[NOTE]

  The calls to _<riscv_save_0>/<riscv_restore_0>_ become 64-bit when the target functions are out of the Â±1MB range, increasing the prologue/epilogue size to 22-bytes.

[NOTE]

  POP is typically used in tail-calling sequences where _ret_ is not used to return to _ra_ after destroying the stack frame.

[#pushpop-areg-list]

=== Compiler implementation

The technique used in the initial implementation in LLVM is to let the compiler generate the function prologue and epilogue, 
and then replace the instruction sequences with the relevant PUSH/POP instructions.

==== Stack pointer adjustment handling

The instructions all automatically adjust the stack pointer by enough to cover the memory required for the registers being saved or restored. 
Additionally the _spimm_ field in the encoding allows the stack pointer to be adjusted by extra 16-byte blocks. There is only a small restricted
range available in the encoding; if the range is insufficient then a separate _c.addi16sp_ can be used to increase the range.

==== Register list handling

The instructions do not directly support _{ra, s0-s10}_ to reduce the amount of encoding space required. If this register list is required then _s11_ 
should also be included. This costs a small amount of memory and performance, but saves code-size.

[#pushpop-fault-handling]
=== PUSH/POP Fault handling

The sequence required to execute the PUSH/POP instruction may be interrupted, or may not be able to start execution for several reasons.

* virtual memory page fault or PMP fault
** these can be detected before execution, or during execution if the memory addresses cross a page/PMP boundary
** xTVAL is set to any address which causes the fault
* watchpoint trigger
** these can be detected before execution, or during execution depending on the trigger type (load data triggers require the sequence to have started executing, for example)
** xTVAL is set to any address which causes the fault
* external debug halt
** the halt can treat the whole sequence atomically, or interrupt mid sequence (implementation defined)
* debug halt caused by a trigger
** same comment as watchpoint trigger above
* load access fault
** these are detected while the sequence is executing
** xTVAL is set to the fault address.
* store access fault (precise or imprecise)
** these may be detected while the sequence is executing, or afterwards if imprecise
** xTVAL is set to the fault address.
* interrupts
** these may arrive at any time. An implementation can choose whether to interrupt the sequence or not.

[NOTE]

  xTVAL may be hardwired to zero in an implementation. Recovering from faults such as page faults requires that it is implemented.

In all cases xEPC contains the PC of the PUSH/POP instruction, and xCAUSE is set as expected for the type of fault.

For debug halts DPC is set to the PC of the PUSH/POP instruction.

Because some faults can only be detected during the sequence the core implementation must be able to recover from the fault and re-execute the sequence. 
This may involve executing some or all of the loads and stores from the sequence multiple times before the sequence completes (as multiple faults or multiple interrupts are possible).

Therefore correct execution requires that _sp_ refers to idempotent memory (also see <<pushpop_non-idem-mem>>).

[#pushpop-software-view]
=== Software view of execution

==== Software view of the PUSH sequence

From a software perspective the PUSH sequence appears as:

* A sequence of stores writing the bytes required by the pseudo-code
** The bytes may be written in any order.
** Any of the bytes may be written multiple times.
* A stack pointer adjustment

Because the memory is idempotent and the stores are non-overlapping, they may be reordered, grouped into larger accesses, split into smaller access or any combination of these.

If an implementation allows interrupts during the sequence, and the interrupt handler uses _sp_ to allocate stack memory, then any stores which were executed before the interrupt may be overwritten by the handler. 
This is safe because the memory is idempotent and the stores will be re-executed when execution resumes.

The stack pointer adjustment must only be committed only when it is certain that the entire PUSH instruction will complete 
without triggering any precise faults (for example, page faults), and without the core taking an interrupt.

Stores may also return imprecise faults from the bus. 
It is platform defined whether the core implementation waits for the bus responses before continuing to the final stage of the sequence, 
or handles errors responses after completing the PUSH instruction.

For example:

[source,sail]
--
cm.push  {ra, s0-s5}, -64
--

Appears to software as:

[source,sail]
--
# any bytes from sp-1 to sp-28 may be written multiple times before the instruction completes
# therefore these updates may be visible in the interrupt/exception handler below the stack pointer
sw  s5, -4(sp)   
sw  s4, -8(sp)   
sw  s3,-12(sp)   
sw  s2,-16(sp)  
sw  s1,-20(sp)   
sw  s0,-24(sp)   
sw  ra,-28(sp)   

# this must only execute once, and will only execute after all stores completed without any precise faults
# therefore this update is only visible in the interrupt/exception handler if cm.push has completed
addi sp, sp, -64
--

==== Software view of the POP/POPRET sequence

From a software perspective the POP/POPRET sequence appears as:

* A sequence of loads reading the bytes required by the pseudo-code.
** The bytes may be loaded in any order.
** Any of the bytes may be loaded multiple times.
* A stack pointer adjustment
* An optional LI zero into a0
* An optional RET

If an implementation allows interrupts during the sequence, then any loads which were executed before the interrupt may update architectural state. 
The loads will be re-executed once the handler completes, so the values will be overwritten. 
Therefore it is permitted for an implementation to update some of the destination registers before taking the interrupt or other fault.

The optional load immediate, stack pointer adjustment and optional ret must only be committed only when it is certain that the entire POP/POPRET instruction will complete 
without triggering any precise faults (for example, page faults), and without the core taking an interrupt.

For POPRET once the stack pointer adjustment has been committed the RET must execute.

<<<
For example:

[source,sail]
--
cm.popretz {ra, s0-s3}, 32; 
--

Appears to software as:

[source,sail]
--
# any or all of these load instructions may execute multiple times
# therefore these updates may be visible in the interrupt/exception handler
lw   s3, 28(sp)
lw   s2, 24(sp)
lw   s1, 20(sp)
lw   s0, 16(sp)
lw   ra, 12(sp)

# these must only execute once, will only execute after all loads complete successfully
# all instructions must execute atomically
# therefore these updates are not visible in the interrupt/exception handler

=== Forward progress guarantee

The PUSH/POP sequence has the same forward progress guarantee as executing the instructions from the equivalent assembly sequences.

[[pushpop_non-idem-mem]]
=== Non-idempotent memory handling

An implementation may have a requirement to issue a PUSH/POP instruction to non-idempotent memory. 

==== Error detection

If the core implementation does not support PUSH/POP to non-idempotent memories, the core may use an idempotency PMA to detect it and take a 
load (POP/POPRET) or store (PUSH) access fault exception in order to avoid unpredictable results.

<<<

==== Non-idempotent support

It is possible to support non-idempotent memory. One reason is to re-use PUSH/POP as a restricted form of a load/store multiple instruction to a peripheral,
as there is no generic load/store multiple instruction in the RISC-V ISA. 

If accessing non-idempotent memory then it is _recommended_ to:

. Not allow interrupts during execution
. Not allow external debug halt during execution
. Detect any virtual memory page faults or PMP faults for the whole instruction before starting execution (instead of during the sequence)
. Not split / merge / reorder the generated memory accesses

It is possible that one of the following will still occur during execution:

. Watchpoint trigger
. Load/store access fault

In these cases the core will jump to the debug or exception handler. If execution is required to continue afterwards (so the event is not fatal to the code execution), then the handler is required to do so in software. 

By following these rules memory accesses will only ever be issued once, and decreasing address order.

It is possible for implementations to follow these restricted rules and to safely access both types of memory. 
It is also possible for an implementation to use PMAs to detect the memory type and apply different rules, such as only allowing interrupts if accessing cacheable memory, for example.
